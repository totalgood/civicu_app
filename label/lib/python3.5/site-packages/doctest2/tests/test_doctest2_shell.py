'''These are the tests for the doctest2 shell support

Unfortunately it's very hard to do this in a cross-platform way.
For example, on unix you can write out a text file using ``cat``, on
windows you would use ``type``.

For a particular example, avoid echo in cmd, it does weird things (like trailing
spaces). In general, one separates cmd and sh examples by using a different
prefix.

    $ python3 -c "print('hi, $VAR_NOEXIST')"
    hi, 
    
    cmd> python3 -c "print('hi, $VAR_NOEXIST')"
    hi, $VAR_NOEXIST

Note the blank like that's necessary to separate different types of doctest.

But let's do a few basics that work everywhere,
and use python to do more advanced things. Also, for stuff that's
posix/windows specific, maybe there'll be supplemental tests or something.

    $ (
    > python3 -c "print('these commands are grouped although the precise')"
    > python3 -c "print('semantics of the grouping differ between sh and cmd.')"
    > )
    these commands are grouped although the precise
    semantics of the grouping differ between sh and cmd.
    
    cmd> (
    ? python3 -c "print('these commands are grouped although the precise')"
    ? python3 -c "print('semantics of the grouping differ between sh and cmd.')"
    ? )
    these commands are grouped although the precise
    semantics of the grouping differ between sh and cmd.

Most of the other tests also apply just as much to Python tests, and are covered
in the Python doctest suites.

But with regard to shell testing, doctest2 adds the ability for a single test
to have multiple backends. A shell test like that above might be executed by
either cmd or by a POSIX-compliant sh. In order to add utility, doctest2 will
try to execute it on both, if both are available.

    >>> import doctest2
    >>> from doctest2 import run_docstring_examples
    >>> def f():
    ...     """This test should pass on both cmd and sh:
    ...     
    ...         $ python3 -c "print('herro world')"
    ...         herro world
    ...         
    ...         cmd> python3 -c "print('herro world')"
    ...         herro world
    ...     """
    ...
    >>> from doctest2 import constants
    >>> number_of_shells = constants.HAS_SH + constants.HAS_CMD
    >>> test_results = run_docstring_examples(f, {})
    >>> test_results.failed
    0
    >>> test_results.attempted == number_of_shells
    True

And for testfile...

    >>> import doctest2.tests, os
    >>> from doctest2 import testfile, constants
    >>> number_of_shells = constants.HAS_SH + constants.HAS_CMD
    >>> test_results = testfile('test_doctest2_shell2.py')
    >>> test_results.failed
    0
    >>> test_results.attempted == number_of_shells
    True

and testmod...

    >>> import doctest2.tests, os
    >>> from doctest2 import testmod
    >>> from doctest2.tests import test_doctest2_shell2 as t
    >>> number_of_shells = constants.HAS_SH + constants.HAS_CMD
    >>> test_results = testmod(t)
    >>> test_results.failed
    0
    >>> test_results.attempted == number_of_shells
    True

and the unit test api...

    >>> import doctest2.tests, os, unittest
    >>> from doctest2 import DocFileSuite, DocTestSuite
    >>> from doctest2.tests import test_doctest2_shell2 as t
    >>> number_of_shells = constants.HAS_SH + constants.HAS_CMD
    
    >>> result = DocTestSuite(t).run(unittest.TestResult())
    >>> result.testsRun == number_of_shells
    True
    >>> result.wasSuccessful()
    True
    >>> for t, err in result.errors:
    ...    print(err); print()
    >>> for t, fail in result.failures:
    ...    print(fail); print()
    
    >>> result = DocFileSuite('test_doctest2_shell2.py').run(unittest.TestResult())
    >>> result.testsRun == number_of_shells
    True
    >>> result.wasSuccessful()
    True

Also, commented directives are supported, even on cmd, which lacks a comment
mechanism (inline, anyway). doctest filters out things that look like bash
comments containing doctest directives, before they are
passed to the shell.

    cmd> python3 -c "print(1)" # this would be text in cmd, but it's filtered out.
    1
    cmd> # the below comment is a doctest directive.
    cmd> python3 -c "print(1, 2)" # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ...2

The comment parsing used to use Python's tokenizer, but it now uses pygments
and the pygments (ba)sh tokenizer. So for example, the second directive would be
ignored (incorrectly), because doctest would recognize Python's triple quotes,
and the first (fake) directive, which made the rest of the line a comment.
Sound complicated? It's not so bad, honest:

    $ echo """ " """ # doctest: BLAH BLAH " # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ...BLAH BLAH...

Test skipping does work, it's sort of a weird process that I unfortunately
wrote without testing. Basically there are signals sent as to whether the next
test should proceed, and the test waits until it gets the signal before it
does so.

    $ python3 -c "print(1)" # doctest: +SKIP
    2
    $ python3 -c "print(2)"
    2

Syntax errors, in sh, are reported and skipped. cmd is not nearly as forgiving.

    $ echo " # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ...
    $ # the above is some shell-specific error message. Don't try this in cmd.
